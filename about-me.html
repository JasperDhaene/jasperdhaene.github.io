                    <p>
                        I started out as a full-stack developer in a customer support team. After mentoring new developers and first-line support, I moved on to full time feature development. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm very curious about how the product I'm developing works and I'm constantly thinking about holistic improvements. I specialised in maintaining a high standard of UI/UX across the engineering team through functional testing and code reviews. With an eye for detail, I've championed customer needs and help out wherever I can.
                    </p>
                    <p>   
                        Besides creating easy to understand tools for your customers, I believe the next best thing to help them is to have great documentation, allowing them to help themselves. I have experience in technical writing ranging from regular contributions about new features, to rewriting (and redesigning) an entire customer-facing knowledge base. I love helping out colleagues outside the engineering team through writing as well. I've created internal guides and feature explainers for other teams. I've also written blog posts and made product videos for marketing purposes. 
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        I'm currently interested in sharpening my design skills with a UI/UX Designer role.
